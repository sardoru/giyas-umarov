## Timeline
1. **1946:** Traveled to Leningrad for grad school in nuclear physics. Famously met Academician S.I. Vavilov on university steps, who got him into Radium Institute under V.G. Khlopin.
2. **1949:** Defended dissertation at Moscow State University. Pre-defense debate with Lev Landau over neutrino mass. Umarov proposed neutrino mass ≤ 1/50-1/100 electron mass (vs prevailing 0.3-0.8). Landau's review: "the dissertator remained with his opinion, and the opponent with his." MSU council voted unanimously (43 members).
3. **1949:** Offered prestigious Moscow position. Said no. Returned to Tashkent to build family and scientific capacity.
4. **1950s:** First to teach advanced physics in Uzbek language at Central Asian Polytechnic Institute.
5. **1954:** At All-Union Conference, proposed tower-type solar power plant with heliostat field (now widely used).
6. **1957:** Organized Uzbek scientists group at JINR Dubna ("Soviet CERN"). Developed beta-spectrograph on permanent magnet.
7. **1958:** Organized plasma laboratory at Physico-Technical Institute, Tashkent, under direction of I.V. Kurchatov. Kurchatov sent two wagons of equipment.
8. **1960s:** Organized first Heliopolygon at Physical-Technical Institute. Tashkent became "Mecca of Heliotechnicians."
9. **1963:** Shifted fully to heliotechnology. Founded Helio Department (4 labs + design bureau) at FTI. Founded journal "Heliotechnika" (still republished in US by Springer as "Applied Solar Energy").
10. **1973:** Participated in UNESCO symposium "The Sun at the Service of Humanity" in Paris. Visited Solar Furnace in Odeillo, France. Published "Biruni, Copernicus, and Modern Science."
11. **1975:** Demonstrated Solar Furnace principle to V.A. Kirillin (Chairman, State Committee for Science and Technology). Presented to Military-Industrial Commission chaired by D.F. Ustinov (future Defense Minister). ON HIS BIRTHDAY Dec 25!
12. **1976:** CPSU Central Committee + USSR Council of Ministers adopted resolution to build Large Solar Furnace (LSF) near Tashkent (May 5, 1976).
13. **1981:** Convened meeting on solar-fuel power plants (SFPP) in Tashkent. Research cited alongside 13 Nobel laureates in Zeldovich & Khlopov's neutrino mass article in Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk.
14. **1987:** Large Solar Furnace built (under Azimov S.A.'s leadership).
15. **1988:** Patented device for selecting heated irrigation water from upper reservoir layers.
16. **Late life:** Actively participated in Aral Sea rescue. Addressed Gorbachev. Member of restoration committee.
17. **Last work:** Article on methods of maintaining stable plasma equilibrium in a tokamak. "A man who dreamed of using the power of plasma and the Sun to improve people's lives."

## Famous Quotes About Him
- Prof. Daniel Alpert (USA, Davos 1990): "His research was 50-60 years ahead of its time, and now we see how his bold ideas are being realized. Therefore, we all consider him our mentor."
- Landau's review: "The dissertator remained with his opinion, and the opponent with his."
- V.G. Khlopin on failed lab demo: "That's called the Visit Effect" — then accepted him as graduate student.

## Agricultural Solar Energy Work
- Solar drying of agricultural products
- Pulsed irradiation of cotton for yield/early ripening
- Solar desalination
- Photo-destructive polymeric films for mulching cotton
- Ridge-profiled cotton beds (with Prof. S.P. Pulatov)
- Heated irrigation water selection device (patent, 1988)

## Institutional Roles
- Member, Scientific Council of USSR Academy of Sciences ("Exploring new ways of using solar energy")
- Member, Scientific Council of State Committee for Science and Technology of USSR on energy
- Member, bureau of Central Scientific and Technical Society of Ministry of Energy of USSR
- Chairman, Problem Council on heliotechnics of Academy of Sciences of Uzbek SSR
- Deputy chief editor, journal "Heliotechnika"
- Member, Committee for Restoration of Aral Sea

## Cultural: The Suzani Connection
- Wife Nabira pictured in front of family suzani
- Suzani = ancient Uzbek textile with sun/planet/moon motifs ("falak" = "sky")
- Umarov family suzani: large sun in center, smaller discs with spirals on "orbits"
- Legend: first "sun and moon" suzani made by bride of Mirzo Ulugbek's student

## Published Works (Monographs)
1. "Beta-Spectrographs with Permanent Magnets" (Abdurazzakov, Gromov, Umarov, 1970)
2. "Biruni, Copernicus, and Modern Science" (1973, translated to English as "At the Crossroads of the Millennium", 2001)
3. "Solar Energy" (with Ershov, Moscow, 1974)
